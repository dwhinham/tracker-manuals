 Hi there music lovers!

 We finally made it; AHX Version 2.xx
 has come to stay! At last we can be
 proud of saying that it is the best!

 There has been a lot of changes this
 time, especially to finally include
 filtering, preferences and volume-
 meters in AHX. And it works! (as far as
 we know, at least). 
 Don't hesitate to contact us if you
 can't get it working or there's some-
 thing you can't figure out.

<-- GENERAL     UP/DOWN   MAINSCREEN -->
 Some technical info:

   Sourcecode: 326k / 14500 lines
 Main Program: 186k (unpacked)
     GFX data: 60k (unpacked)
     Worktime: 9958654985476 hours
     ASM time: about 27 minutes

 'I hate this!'
 --------------
 Dexter had quite a job this time, and
 since we don't have more AHX coders,
 and he's extraordinarely lazy, it
 was hell on earth. He coded the filters
 about 12-13 times and much time was
<-- GENERAL    UP/DOWN    MAINSCREEN -->
 lost on thinking about why it doesn't
 work but afterwards, it all ended well.

 You're looking at the result now. :-)
 What do you think?!
 
 AHX finally deserves to be
 called 'the best sid tracker around',
 which many of you have been calling
 it in your psychotic letters to us... 
 
 One thing that surprised us though, 
 was the fact that all of you said
 it was "great", "superb" and so on.

<-- GENERAL     UP/DOWN   MAINSCREEN -->
 Very few (Noone!) complained or came
 up with new, original ideas and/or
 useful features! Most of the things
 in AHX2.0 are self-invented, but thanks
 must go to the Hamre brothers who wrote
 the original pt-docs and of course to
 MAHONEY&KAKTUS. Thanks guys, you really
 are a great bunch of people!

 The small gadgets labeled marked with

 ## speaker symbols ##
 represent the audiochannels of your
 amiga. When lit, that channel is on.
 When not lit, the channel is muted
 and and the notes in that track will
 not be played.

*You can also use ctrl-a to toggle an
*audiochannel, and ctrl-q to unmute all
*channels. Ctrl+shift-a will solo the
*current channel.

 -----------

 Clicking on the instrument up/down
 gadgets will flicker through the
 instruments. You can use up to 63,
 or hex $3F instruments in a song.

 Holding down the right button when
 pressing the Pos, Len, Ins and Res
 gadgets will speed them up a bit.



<-- AHX         UP/DOWN   PLIST CMDS -->
             EFFECT COMMANDS
             ---------------

 Effect commands on AHX should mostly
 be compatible with all other trackers. 

 0 - None/JumpPos Hi   8 - Ext. Timing
 1 - Portamento Up     9 - Overr. Square
 2 - Portamento Down   A - VolumeSlide
 3 - TonePortamento    B - PositionJump
 4 - Set/Overr. Filter C - Set Volume
 5 - ToneP + VolSlide  D - PatternBreak
 6 - * NOT USED *      E - Misc. Cmds
 7 - * NOT USED *      F - Set Speed

<-- PLIST CMDS   DOWN       KEYBOARD -->
 Cmd 0. Set Pos-Jump Hi [HiPos:$0-$9]
 ------------------------------------
 Usage: $0 + positionjump hi

 Jumping to e.g. position 123 (decimal)
 must be done using Cmd. $0 + $01 and
 Cmd. $B + $23. Value will be reset to
 $00 after jumping (using $B) to the
 desired position.

 Example: ---00002  0 is the command,
                 2 is positionjump hi



<-- PLIST CMDS  UP/DOWN     KEYBOARD -->
 Cmd 1. Portamento up [Speed:$00-$FF]
 ------------------------------------
 Usage: $1 + portamento speed

 Portamento up will simply slide the
 sample pitch up. You can NOT slide
 higher than B-5! (Period 113)
 Example: C-300103  1 is the command,
            3 is the portamentospeed.
 NOTE: The portamento will be called as
 many times as the speed of the song.
 This means that you'll sometimes have 
 trouble sliding accuratly. If you
 change the speed without changing the
 sliderates, it will sound bad...
<-- PLIST CMDS  UP/DOWN     KEYBOARD -->
 Cmd 2. Portamento down [Speed:$00-FF]
 -------------------------------------
 Usage: $2 + portamento speed

 Just like command 1, except that this
 one slides the pitch down instead.
 (Adds to the period).

 You can NOT slide lower than C-1!
 (Period 856)

 Example: C-300203  2 is the command,
            3 is the portamentospeed.


<-- PLIST CMDS  UP/DOWN     KEYBOARD -->
 Cmd 3. Tone-portamento [Speed:$00-$FF]
 -------------------------------------- 
 Usage: Dest-note + $3 + slidespeed
 WON'T WORK IF THE TRACK IS TRANSPOSED!!

 This command will automatically slide
 from the old note to the new.
 You don't have to worry about which
 direction to slide, you need only set
 the slide speed. To keep on sliding,
 just select the command $3 + 00.
 Example: A-200000  First play a note.
          C-300305  C-3 is the note to
               slide to, 3 the command,
               and 5 the speed.
<-- PLIST CMDS  UP/DOWN     KEYBOARD -->
 Cmd 4. Set/O. Filter [$01-$3F,$41-$7F]
 --------------------------------------
 Usage: $4 + filter / filter+$40

 Example: C-300405  4 is the command,
 5 is filter $05 (when Cmd 0 in pList),
          C-300443  4 is the command,
 43 is filter $03 and set filter immed.

 Values $01-$3F will override Cmd.$0 in
 pList and set the filter when it's set
 through Cmd.$0 in the pList.
 Add $40 to the filter you want to set
 to set the filter immediately.

<-- PLIST CMDS  UP/DOWN     KEYBOARD -->
 Cmd 5. ToneP + Volsl [Spd:$0-$F/$0-$F]
 --------------------------------------
 Usage: $5 + upspeed + downspeed

 This command will continue the current
 toneportamento and slide the volume
 at the same time. Stolen from NT2.0.

 Example: C-300503  3 is the speed to
                turn the volume down.

          C-300540  4 is the speed to
                         slide it up.


<-- PLIST CMDS  UP/DOWN     KEYBOARD -->
 Cmd 8. External Timing [User:$01-$FF]
 -------------------------------------
 Usage: $8 + externaltimingdata

 This command will set the External
 Timing byte in replayer's public-mem
 section. Refer to replayer's documen-
 tation for further information/usage.

 Example: ---00827  27 is the value set
                   for external timing.




<-- PLIST CMDS  UP/DOWN     KEYBOARD -->
 Cmd 9. Set SquareRelation [SR:$01-$3F]
 --------------------------------------
 Usage: $9 + square-relation

 This command will set the square-
 relation (set in pList using Cmd.$3xx)
 immediately and will disable the first
 $3xx Cmd. (if appearing in the pList).
 Example: C-300920 20 is the square-
                            relation
          ---00918 18 is the square-
                            relation
          ---00910 10 is the square-
                            relation

<-- PLIST CMDS  UP/DOWN     KEYBOARD -->
 Cmd A. Volumeslide [Speed:$0-$F/$0-$F]
 --------------------------------------
 Usage: $A + upspeed + downspeed

 Example: C-300A05  5 is the speed to
                turn the volume down.

          C-300A40  4 is the speed to
                         slide it up.

 NOTE: The slide will be called as
 many times as the speed of the song.
 The slower the song, the more the
 volume will be changed on each note.

<-- PLIST CMDS  UP/DOWN     KEYBOARD -->
 Cmd B. Position-jump [Pos:$00-$99]
 ----------------------------------
 Usage: $B + position to continue at

 Example: C-300B00  B is the command,
                 0 is the position to
                 restart the song at.

 This command will also perform a
 pattern-break (see 2 pages below).

 You have to enter the position in
 decimal (NOT in hex as in PT). Use
 Cmd. $0 to jump to positions >100.

<-- PLIST CMDS  UP/DOWN     KEYBOARD -->
 Cmd C. Set volume [Volume:see below]
 ------------------------------------
 Usage: $C+$00-$40: Instrument volume
        $C+$50-$90: VMvol. 4 all voices
        $C+$A0-$E0: Voice Master vol.

 Well, this old familiar command will
 set the current volume to your own
 selected. The highest volume is $40.
 All volumes are represented in hex.
 (Programmers do it in hex, you know!)

 Example: C-300C10  C is the command,
       10 is the volume (16 decimal).

<-- PLIST CMDS  UP/DOWN     KEYBOARD -->
 Cmd D. Pattern-break
           [Pattern-pos:00-63, decimal]
 -------------------------------------- 
 Usage: $D + pattern-position

 This command just jumps to the next
 song-position, and continues play
 from the patternposition you specify.
 Example: C-300D00  Jump to the next
     song-position and continue play
            from patternposition 00.
      Or: C-300D32  Jump to the next
     song-position and continue play
    from patternposition 32 instead.

<-- PLIST CMDS  UP/DOWN     KEYBOARD -->
              E - COMMANDS
              ------------

 The E command has been altered to
 contain more commands than one.

 E0- * NOT USED *      E8- * NOT USED *
 E1- Fineslide Up      E9- * NOT USED *
 E2- Fineslide Down    EA- FineVol Up
 E3- * NOT USED *      EB- FineVol Down

<-- PLIST CMDS  UP/DOWN     KEYBOARD -->
 Cmd E1. Fineslide up [Range:$0-$F]
 ----------------------------------
 Usage: $E1 + value

 This command works just like the
 normal portamento up, except that
 it only slides up once. It does not
 continue sliding during the length of
 the note.

 Example: C-300E11  Slide up 1 at the
                    beginning of the
                    note.

 (Great for creating chorus effects)
<-- PLIST CMDS  UP/DOWN     KEYBOARD -->
 Cmd E2. Fineslide down [Range:$0-$F]
 ------------------------------------
 Usage: $E2 + value

 This command works just like the
 normal portamento down, except that
 it only slides down once. It does not
 continue sliding during the length of
 the note.

 Example: C-300E26  Slide down 6 at the
                    beginning of the
                    note.


<-- PLIST CMDS  UP/DOWN     KEYBOARD -->
 Cmd E4. VibratoDepth [Value:$0-$F]
 ----------------------------------
 Usage: $E4 + VibratoDepth.

 This command will set/override the
 VibratoDepth value set in the
 current instrument's Performance-
 List!

 Example: C-301000  Hit Insturment 1
          ---00E40  Stop Vibrato
          ---00E48  Medium Vibrato



<-- PLIST CMDS  UP/DOWN     KEYBOARD -->
 Cmd EA. FineVolsl up [Range:$0-$F]
 ----------------------------------
 Usage: $EA + value

 This command works just like the
 normal volumeslide up, except that
 it only slides up once. It does not
 continue sliding during the length o
 the note.

 Example: C-300EA3  Slide volume up 1
                    at the beginning
                    of the note.


<-- PLIST CMDS  UP/DOWN     KEYBOARD -->
 Cmd EB. FineVolsl down [Range:$0-$F]
 ------------------------------------
 Usage: $EB + value

 This command works just like the

             GENERAL INFO.
             -------------
 Making Music
 ------------
 Any piece of music written with AHX
 is built up from positions.
 Each position is built up from four
 tracks, one for each of the amiga's
 audiochannels.

 A pattern is 64 lines long. The magni-
 fied line is always the one you edit.
 If you need shorter patterns, just set
 the TrackLength (TRL) field or use the
 patternbreak effect command.
<-- KEYBOARD     DOWN            AHX -->

 A track is built up like this:

     32  C-3 01 C20
     /   \_/ I/ \_/
    /    /   I    \
 Step Note Instr. Effect cmd.

 The C-3 is the note being played at
 trackposition 32. 01 is the instrument
 number, and the three last digits are
 the effect command, in this case, set
 volume to $20 (C-Command, 20-Value).


<-- KEYBOARD    UP/DOWN          AHX -->

 Protracker holds a table with info 
 about the sequence in which the tracks
 will be played. With the "Pos" gadget
 you determine your position in the
 table. Enter the 4 "Tracks" and the
 "Transposing" that define what track
 to play transposed or not at that
 position. "Length" defines the total
 size of the table. The full sequence
 of tracks is the Song. A song is built
 up from up to 256 different tracks,
 4 of them being played at up to 999
 different positions.
