# Music Tracker Manuals

Here's some printable manuals and cheatsheets for various music trackers that I've put together over the years:

* [AHX - Abyss' Highest Experience](ahx/ahxusersguide-redux-1.0pre4-standard.pdf) - last updated: 27/7/2010
* [Protracker Command Reference](protracker/protracker-command-reference.pdf) - last updated: 21/2/2012
  * The source Word document has been lost. ðŸ˜¥

## TODO:

I'll probably re-write these in a modern, portable format like Markdown so that they can be read online or converted to LaTeX or PDF nicely.

Pull requests and documentation contributions welcome!
